A streamlit app that allows users to click and generate their own Christmas movie plots using a **Long Short Term Memory model** trained on 855 movie plots using **PyTorch**.

This project demonstrates how to:
- Train a simple generative model (Long Short Term Memory) using **PyTorch**
- Follow a clean, modular, and extensible code structure
- Build a simple interactive Streamlit app
